* Generate Christmas list Permutations

You have to create the link manually, like so:

https://langmartin.github.io/christmas-list/?f1=Alice&f1=Bob&f2=Chuck&f2=David&f3=Ethel&f4=Fred&s=1&y=4

- Each =fN= is a family, aka people who shouldn't give each other gifts
- The family structure is printed by the page, so you can check it
- =s= is similarity, or how many allowed duplicate gift relationships
  the output can contain
- =y= is the number of years to output

The =s= and =y= parameters can cause the stack to overflow, so if you
just get a blank page, that's what happened.
